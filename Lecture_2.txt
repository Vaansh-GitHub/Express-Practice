~~ Restfull API

1. Server and Client Architechture :

Server is different and client is different . Server and Client should be independent
of each other .

2.Always respect all http methods :

Good practices~

GET /user -  read users data and return data
POST /user - handle new user creation
Patch /user - update the user

Bad practices~ why should we mention update,create etc. such words when we are using POST or GET methods we should respect this methods

POST /updateUser - user update
POST /createUser - create user
GET /getUser - get user details


Server Side Rendering (SSR) -> is Fast as we directly render the data what is being sent by the server (Like rendering a HTML file)
Client Side Rendering(CSR)-> is Slow as first we fetch the data then frontend will render the data (Like rendering json files)
